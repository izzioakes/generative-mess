# About

hello! welcome to my first Processing.py code i'm putting up here.
the idea behind this code was to generate out a long line made up by many smaller lines back to back, every time moving in a random direction.

this section of the code:

'''
points = [random(100,width-50), random(100,height-50)]
    
    for i in range(linecount):
        stroke(0)
        strokeWeight(0.5)
        z = random(randomness)
        x = points[-2]
        y = points[-1]
        x2 = x+random(-z,z)
 '''
